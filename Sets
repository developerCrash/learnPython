This Doc Describes Set Data type in python 

## Sets are Unordered, means you cannot access items with an index 
## Ex: my_set[0] -> Throws an error
# Duplicate values are not allowed

## This is minly used to remove Dublicates
my_set = {"abc", 34, True, 40, "male"}

print(my_set)

my_set.add("xyz")
my_set.add("abc") ## Throws error since 'abc' is already present in he set

for i in my_set:
    print(i)

    
if "abc" in my_set:
    print("True")

if "xyz" not in my_set:
    print("False")

print (len(my_set))
